# PA-3DRunner

A 3D Runner? game that we created in Panteon Academy. I added my own ideas later to 3D Runner game that we did while our education in the Panteon Academy. While I was asking myself "is this a Driver game right now rather then a Runner?" since at the beginning I gave my Stickman's a Drivers License here is list what I added later on:
- Added cars.
- Added a start scene where player can choose the color of the Runner?
- Added random color system for the other Runners? other than the choosen one.
- Added a different color palette to the player's ranking placement so its easier to follow.
- Added starting countdown.
- Added health system where it decreases when player hits an obstacle. When health reaches 0 the car explodes and counts as did not finish.
- Added effects to the tires for increasing boost. Added smoke effect after the player is 1 HP. (Trail Renderer)
- Added checkpoint.
- Added coin system rather than score.
- Added temporary magnet power up so that it can pull the surrounding coins.
- Added boost and repair stations which are activated by certain amount of coins.
- Added cheer and dissappointment animations to the player.
- Added cheering crowd right after someone finishes as first.
